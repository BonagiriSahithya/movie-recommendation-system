# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using Python. It suggests movies similar to a selected one based on their descriptions, genres, keywords, cast, and more.

---

## 📌 Features

- Recommend similar movies using content similarity
- Based on metadata like:
  - **Overview**
  - **Genres**
  - **Keywords**
  - **Cast & Crew**
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
- Suitable for learning **machine learning**, **NLP**, and **vectorization techniques**

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Combines relevant columns from the movie dataset
   - Cleans and tokenizes text for each movie

2. **Vectorization:**
   - Uses `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn` to convert text into vectors

3. **Similarity Calculation:**
   - Uses **cosine similarity** to find movies closest to the selected one

4. **Recommendation Function:**
   - Takes a movie name as input
   - Returns top 5 similar movies based on similarity scores
